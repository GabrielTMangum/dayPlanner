*This project was an attempt at making a workday planner.  You can fill in the fields with whatever notes or to-dos that you need and they will be locally stored so that if you leave the app and return to it, the information will still be there.*

*Please enjoy playing around with the planner and feel free to try testing its capabilities.*

*Also notice that the colors of the time slots will change according to what time of day it is!*
